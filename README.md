# iVis-MGX, beta version 

iVis-MGX stands for Interactive Visualization of Metagenomic Data.  It is currently in Beta testing.

iVis-MGX is a tool that transforms the output of the metagenomic processing tools Humann 3.0 and Metaphlan 3.0 into a live website that a researcher can use to visualize and interact with their data.


 
## Examples of Live Sites

## Installation Instructions
0. Run metaphlan 3.0 and humann 3.0 following the instructions from the Huttenhower website. 
1. Create a file, samples.txt, which maps your sampleIDs to a sampleName (shorter usually than the sampleID and better for web visualization) and the experimental condition
2. Clone the github repository
3. Copy the following output files into iVis-Meta/data/raw/
samples.txt (file created in step 1 that maps sampleIDs to experimental condition)
combined_genefamilies.tsv (humann 3.0 output)
combined_genepathways.tsv (humann 3.0 output)
merged_abundance.txt (metaphlan 3.0 output)
